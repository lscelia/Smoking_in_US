### Motivation

It is known that smoking causes a lot of health problems, but according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/osh/index.htm), there were about 34 million U.S. adults smoke cigarettes in 2019, and 58 million nonsmoking people were exposed to secondhand smoke that severely negatively affected their health. Especially since the first laboratory-confirmed case of Covid-19 appeared in the United States on January 20, 2020, bad addictions such as smoking have been highlighted by health organizations looking at their relationship with Covid-19. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) pointed out, "Being a current or former cigarette smoker can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. If you currently smoke, quit. If you used to smoke, don’t start again. If you’ve never smoked, don’t start." Besides, people with certain medical conditions are more likely to get severe Covid-19, and smoking could make their situation worse, because smoking harms the immune system and can make the body less successful at fighting disease. With these information, we examined the trend of smoking in the U.S. in recent years.

Our main objective is to provide information to health organizations and healthcare facilities about the characteristics of smokers and people who quit smoking in the United States, as well as the specific populations which need more attention.

### Screencast


### Data

* [National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm)

The datasets of 2016 to 2020 were downloaded from the websites as mentioned above and were imported. We selected several potential variables for the project and created a YEAR variable to combine the datasets for analysis. The value of the data was given in number indicating the specific response of the participants, so we mutated and recoded the variables based on the codebook. For example, the `disability` variable was renamed from the `disab3_a` variable in the original dataset, and we transferred “1”, “2”, “9”, to “yes”, “no”, “don’t know”, respectively, indicating if the respondent has disability. Then we mutated the variables into factors, except for variables like `year` and `age` which are continuous. There were several variables containing missing value, and we filled them with “missing”. Lastly, we filtered the dataset based on the `smoke` variable that we kept only *current every day smoker*, *current some day smoker*, *former smoker*, and *never smoker*, excluding those with unknown status.

* [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-Table-of-Tobacco-Use/bq95-jg9r)

The dataset was downloaded from BRFSS. It contains the tobacco use information of participants from all age, race , sex and states.Since we are focusing years between 2017 to 2020, `filter` was applied to filtered out `year` equals to 2017-2020.There are 27 columns in the data, we only selected few columns useful to our analysis, which were `locationabbr` (State Name),` geo_location`(latitude and longitude for map),  `sample_size` (sample size),`topic`(only question related to current smoking status is selected).Then we summed up the number of smokers in each state and calculated the smoking proportion with respect to their state.

* [CDC STATE System Tobacco Legislation - Tax](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Legislation/CDC-STATE-System-Tobacco-Legislation-Tax/2dwv-vfam)

Tax data was obtained from CDC open data website. We have three legislation categories (Combustible Tobacco Tax, Non-Combustible Tobacco, and Stamp Tax. Cigarette tax is the most common tax among 58 regions and takes a majority of available data (>90%) in this dataset (Some region did not specify tax for less common types of combustible and non-combustible tobacco). In this case, we selected cigarette tax value ($ per pack) under Combustible Tobacco category in 2021 and drop out meaningless columns as well as NA values. After that, we ranked 58 regions by cigarette tax value.

* [Quitline – Service Utilization - 2010 To Present](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Quitline/Quitline-Service-Utilization-2010-To-Present/equ4-92qe)

The dataset was downloaded from the CDC open data website. It was filtered by `locations` (states in the U.S.) because it contains data from other regions. Also, it was filtered by the categorical variable `Counseling and/or Medications` for studying smokers who seeks for help in counseling and/or medication. Then, we filtered the data by `year` because we want to focus on smokers in 2020. Since the original data value was the number of calls per 1000 tobacco users, we divided the value by 1000 for better readability. Finally, the dataset is ready to be visualized.


### Initial Questions
 
1. What is the overall smoking trend in the years between 2017 and 2020? What is the distribution of smoker among different age group, race and sex?
2.Which states has the highest and the lowest smoking proportion? Which states has the largest increase/ decrease in smoking proportion over the past 4 years?
3. What is the distribution of smokers among subgroups defined by demographic characteristics, during the Covid-19 pandemic?
4. Is there a decrease in current smoking rates among people with specific medical conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the previous year?
5. What is the situation of quitting smoke in 2020?

* [Quit Smoking Analysis](quit_smoke.html)

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis is not applicable to our project, because the circumstances that lead a person to smoke or quit are complex. Smoking or quitting is a personal choice that may be influenced by factors such as education level, sexual orientation and social networking, but such analyses are too large. It is also difficult to extract a few or dozens of factors from hundreds of questions in the health surveys to produce a statistically significant model of smoking. If to analyze and predict smoking rates in the United States, more datasets are needed to calculate the smoking rate in the previous year, which is a huge amount of processing, and the variables can change from year to year, especially since Covid-19 started. Therefore, we just used the data to show the recent situation of smoking in the United States.

### Overall Findings


### Discussion
When working on this project, we find out several limitations. First, as discussed in the Statistical Analysis section, we find it difficult to conduct a statistical significant model because of the complex variables. These survey data are potentially biased as we are unable to control how the respondents answer the questionnaire. Second, when tidying our datasets, we found out there is not a very strict rule to define a smoker. The only categorical we have is whether the respondent is a current every day smoker, current some day smoker, former smoker and never smoker. Third, we only focus on cigarettes due to limited data, while there are many forms of tobacco smoking, such as little cigarettes, cigar and other non-combustible smoking, such as chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes.
